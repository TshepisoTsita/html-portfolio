<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> 
Hi, I’m Tshepiso Tsita a young Black woman who's diving headfirst into the world of web development.
 This is one of the exciting new "hats" I've added to my skill set, and I’m already hooked on the thrill of coding and designing for the web. When I'm not debugging or crafting user interfaces, I’m running my beauty therapy business, where I love helping clients feel and look their best. 
 I’m also passionate about giving back, especially to school children in need—whether through donations, mentorship, or community initiatives. I truly believe in the power of continuous growth, so I’m always learning something new, both personally and professionally.
  Whether I’m perfecting a skincare routine, building a website, or supporting a child’s education, I bring enthusiasm, empathy, and curiosity to everything I do.
